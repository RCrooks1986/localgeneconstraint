---Functions Files---

Functions files are used to store common procedures. These can be placed in a common directory and shared by a number of applications if you wish.

All function files are titled '*-functions.php' due to a functions management system I use
Function files have the format:
//---FunctionBreak---
/*
*/
//---DocumentBreak---
function
//---FunctionBreak---

The 'functions/dna-functions.php' file is intended to be a shared functions file that other applications that I manage can use
